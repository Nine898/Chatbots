# 🗣️ Non-AI Chatbots Repository

Welcome to the **Non-AI Chatbots Repository**—a collection of diverse, rule-based chatbots that don’t rely on artificial intelligence! This is a personal project dedicated to exploring structured chatbot logic, decision trees, and scripting-based conversational agents.

## 📜 About This Repository

This repository showcases various non-AI chatbots designed for specific functions. Unlike AI-driven chatbots, these bots follow predefined scripts, rules, and logic to interact with users. Perfect for situations that require reliability, transparency, and strict control over responses.

## 🏗️ Current Chatbots

- **Helpline Chatbot** – A support chatbot that provides predefined guidance and resources for users seeking assistance.
- **Weather-Based Day Planner** – Helps users plan their day based on forecasted weather conditions, offering structured suggestions for activities.

## 🚧 Under Development  

I'm actively working on expanding this collection! The following chatbots are **currently in progress** and will be added soon:

- **Story Bot** – An interactive chatbot that guides users through narratives where choices determine the outcome.
- **Emoji-Only Chatbot** – A playful chatbot that only communicates using emojis, encouraging users to decipher and reply in the same way.

## 🎯 How These Bots Work

Each chatbot operates using **hardcoded logic**, such as:

- **Keyword Matching** – Bots respond based on detected keywords.
- **Decision Trees** – Predefined paths guide interactions.
- **Pattern-Based Scripting** – Responses follow programmed rules.

## 🤝 Contributions & Ideas  

While this is a personal project, I'm always open to feedback, suggestions, and creative chatbot concepts. If you have an idea for a non-AI chatbot, feel free to share!

## 💡 Why Non-AI?

Non-AI chatbots are:

- **Transparent** – No unpredictable responses.
- **Efficient** – Low computational requirements.
- **Dependable** – Perfect for specific-use cases where AI isn’t needed.
